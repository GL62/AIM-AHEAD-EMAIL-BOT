# email-automation-with-gpt-ai-and-python
An example of using the OpenAI API in python to automate email responses

1. This script was created to automatically reply to emails in an email inbox using OpenAI API. <br />
   The script allows you to reply to only unread messages or to all messages in the inbox. <br />
   Sent messages are moved to the specified folder.

2. The program is ready to use. You only need: <br />
   a.) Install the OpenAI library:<br />
   ```sh
   pip install openai
   ```
   b.) Complete the API key and login details 

   

4. If you find a bug or have an idea to improve the program, please e-mail me.

5. If you appreciate my work, you can buy me a coffee: <br />
